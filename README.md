# Simplecrypt

## Dependencies:
    - Random
    - Regex

Simple encryption module for strings and text files coded in base ASCII with a homemade algorithm, should not be used for anything serious but will provide enough offuscation to make it unreadable, and it would be really hard to decode by hand.
